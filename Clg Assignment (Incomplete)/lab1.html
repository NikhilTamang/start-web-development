    <b>Subject: <u style="color: blue">Application for Sick Leave</u></b>

    <p>Dear Sir,</p>

    <p>
      I am writing to inform you that I am currently unwell and,
      <i>due to my illness, am unable to attend classes</i> for the period
      from<strong>[Falgun 25]</strong> to<strong>[Chaitra 04].</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
      I kindly request you to grant me sick leave for these days. I will ensure
      to catch up on all missed work as soon as I am able.
    </p>

    <p>Thank you for your understanding and consideration.</p>

    <p>
      Sincerely,<br />
      Nikhil Tamang <br />
